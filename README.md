# SPI Memory Verification using UVM

## Overview

This project presents a **SystemVerilog UVM-based testbench** to verify an **SPI Memory** module. It follows industry-standard verification methodologies with a modular, scalable, and reusable testbench architecture. The design under verification includes a memory block and an SPI controller, and the verification environment is fully constrained-random with functional coverage.

## Testbench Architecture

The entire UVM environment is encapsulated in a **package (`pkg`)**, allowing for easy reuse and integration. 
The `agent` includes the following components:
- **Driver**
- **Monitor**
- **Sequencer**
- **Sequence (with multiple randomized and directed tests)**

A single **UVM Agent** handles SPI transactions, and the testbench includes:

- **Environment**
- **Scoreboard**
- **Subscriber**
- **SPI Interface**

## Key Features

- âœ… **Modular UVM Testbench** with `agent`, `env`, and `test` separation
- âœ… **Integrated Functional Coverage** on both `address` and `data` fields
- âœ… **100% Functional Coverage Achieved**
- âœ… **Reusable Class Packaging (`pkg`)**
- âœ… **Constrained Random Testing**
- âœ… **Assertions and Self-Checking Scoreboard**
- âœ… **Testcase Scalability** for future protocol extensions

---


## Coverage

The following covergroups were implemented to ensure exhaustive testing:

- `cg_data` â€“ Covers all possible SPI data values
- `cg_address` â€“ Covers all valid memory address ranges

âœ… **Coverage Results**:  
- `cg_data`: 100%  
- `cg_address`: 100%
- Functional coverage report available in the `coverage_data.txt` .

## Simulation

- Simulator Used: **Aldec Rivieria Pro 2023.04**
- Test Results: All testcases passed successfully with zero failures.

## Conclusion

This UVM environment provides a robust verification solution for SPI Memory systems, demonstrating full functional coverage and a reusable modular structure.

> **Note**: All verification components are wrapped under a single package `pkg` to streamline reuse and minimize integration effort in future projects.
